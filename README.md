# VowelBender

*VowelBender* is a *Praat* application that simulates the effect of changes in articulation and articulatory limitations on vowels in speech. 
*VowelBender* takes any speech recordings and changes the formant characteristics of the voiced parts according to the specifications.

*VowelBender* is mainly designed to help studying the perceptual consequences of changes in articulatory vowel space on the perception of speech, eg, intelligibility, and data augmentation for training Deep Neural Networks.
