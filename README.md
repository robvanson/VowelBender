# VowelBender
VowelBender is a Praat application that simulates the effect of changes in articulation and articulatory limitations on vowels in speech. 
VowelBender takes any speech and changes the formant characteristics of the voiced parts according to the specifications.

VowelBender is mainly designed to help studying the perceptual consequences of changes in articulatory vowel space on the perception of speech, eg, intelligibility, and data augmentation for training Deep Neural Networks.
